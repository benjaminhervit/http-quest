- [ ] when a validation fails, then return the error to the request with bad request code
- [ ] When a parsed request is validated, then pass it on to authentication
- [ ] when an authentication fails, then return the error to the requester with bad request code
- [ ] When an authentication passes, then build context for the game manager
- [ ] When the game manager runs successfully, then return the response to the request with ok request code
